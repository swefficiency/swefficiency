If this expression object was itself iterable (e.g., a large matrix), `uniquely_named_symbol` might have attempted to iterate over its internal components to find existing symbols, leading to an expensive and unnecessary deep traversal. By wrapping the expression in a list (`[expr]`), the function now correctly receives a collection containing a single expression, ensuring it extracts symbols from the top-level expression efficiently and avoids the costly deep iteration.", "confidence": "high", "instance_id": "sympy__sympy-26063", "repo": "sympy/sympy"}

Instead of repeatedly invoking the general `vec.diff` symbolic differentiation method for each generalized speed, the new implementation utilizes `linear_eq_to_matrix`. This function directly extracts coefficients from the vector's components with respect to the generalized speeds, assuming a linear relationship. This specialized algorithmic approach avoids the computational overhead of general symbolic differentiation, resulting in a faster calculation of partial velocities.", "confidence": "high", "instance_id": "sympy__sympy-26367", "repo": "sympy/sympy"}
