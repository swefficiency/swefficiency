Previously, this method iterated over all `rows * cols` elements of a matrix, calling `atoms()` on each. For sparse matrices, like the one used in the workload (1000x1000 with 0.1% density), this meant redundant calls to `atoms()` on many `S.Zero` objects. The updated code now retrieves only the non-zero elements via `self.values()` and iterates solely over them, significantly reducing the number of `atoms()` calls and set operations. It also explicitly accounts for `S.Zero` if it's being searched for in a sparse matrix, further streamlining the process.", "confidence": "high", "instance_id": "sympy__sympy-26057", "repo": "sympy/sympy"}

Instead of passing a single expression (`expr` or `aug`), it now consistently passes a list containing that expression (e.g., `[expr]`). This change likely streamlines the internal logic of `uniquely_named_symbol` by ensuring it always receives an iterable. By providing the expected input type, the function can avoid internal type checks, implicit conversions, or less optimized code paths that might have handled a non-iterable argument, thereby reducing redundant work during symbol name generation, especially in the `_gauss_jordan_solve` path used by the workload.", "confidence": "high", "instance_id": "sympy__sympy-26063", "repo": "sympy/sympy"}

Instead of iteratively calling `vec.diff(speed, ...)` for each generalized speed, which involves general symbolic differentiation, the new code uses `linear_eq_to_matrix`. This function efficiently extracts coefficients of all generalized speeds from the vector's components in a single pass. This approach is more efficient because it leverages the typical linearity of velocity components with respect to generalized speeds, avoiding the overhead of repeated, general symbolic differentiation operations.", "confidence": "high", "instance_id": "sympy__sympy-26367", "repo": "sympy/sympy"}

It initializes `arr1` and `arr2` to count only odd numbers, effectively halving the data processed. Furthermore, it introduces a `skip` array to implement a sieve-like mechanism, allowing the algorithm to skip composite numbers in its main iteration (`for i in range(3, lim + 1, 2)`) and inner loops (`if skip[j]: continue`), thereby reducing redundant computations and improving the overall algorithmic complexity.", "confidence": "high", "instance_id": "sympy__sympy-26710", "repo": "sympy/sympy"}

For these smaller values, instead of performing a binary search using the computationally intensive `li` (logarithmic integral) function and `log().evalf()` calls, the code directly extends the global `sieve` object to precompute primes up to an empirically determined bound (`8 * n`). This allows for a fast, direct lookup from the `sieve` (which acts as a cache), significantly reducing the computational cost for frequently requested smaller primes by avoiding repeated complex calculations.", "confidence": "high", "instance_id": "sympy__sympy-27051", "repo": "sympy/sympy"}
